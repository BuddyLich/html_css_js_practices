## Notes

### CSS:
1. The plus sign can be used to select the some object next to certain object

e.g.


    .toggle:checked + .label .ball {
    animation: slideOn 0.3s linear forwards;
    }

### HTML:
1. You can do the check/uncheck by clicking the label for check input, instead of the tic box itself. Didn't know that before.
