## Note of this course:

### Having a general understanding of flex layout
1. use `display: flex;` to activate the flex layout
   

2. use `align-items: center;` and `justify-content: center;` to put object into center
   vertically and horizontally
   

3. use `justify-content: space-evenly;` to make elements inside flex container shares equal distance
   , including the distance to the border
   

4. `flex-direction: column;` makes objects placed vertically, 
   

   and `flex-direction: row;` makes them placed horizontally
5. `flex: 1;` or `flex: 2;` or `flex: 3;` decides how many spaces different objects shares

### The use of linear-gradient
e.g.

    background: linear-gradient(to right top, #65dfc9, #6cdbeb);


    background: linear-gradient(
        to left top,
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8),
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
    );
### Others
1. 50% border radius can make square div into circle
   

2. `z-index: 2` decides which element is displayed at front
   

3. `align-items: center;` makes divs center but not text
   

4. `text-align: center;` makes the text center
