## Notes

### CSS:
1. In a flex box, you can use `justify-content: flex-end;` to put element start from the end of the box
2. When there are only three numbers in the padding property, such as `padding: 0.5rem 1rem 1rem;`, it means top 0.5rem, left and right 1rem, bottom 1rem


### JavaScript:
`event.preventDefault()` this can prevent the default behavior/function of an element, such as a form's data submition, or checkbox being selected
