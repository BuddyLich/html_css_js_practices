## Notes:

### CSS:
1. The size of `<input>` change with `font-size`


### JavaScript:
1. to add/remove a class for an object, it's better to use `someObject.classList.toggle('className');` 
,other than using bunch of if - else to check if the object has/doesn't have certain class


2. `input.focus()` can be used to put focus on an input tag
