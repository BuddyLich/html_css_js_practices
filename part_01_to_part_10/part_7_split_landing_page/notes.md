## Notes:

### CSS:
1. If there is a div which takes a picture as background, 
   and I want another layer of 0.7 transparent color in front of that div, I realize that by adding a div-name::before object,
   and give an empty content and 0.7 transparent color to its background. 


### JavaScript:
1. The use of 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' in addEventListener
