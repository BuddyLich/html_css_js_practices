## Note:

### CSS:
1. The use of `overflow-x: hidden;`


2. In CSS, two classes with space such as `.class-a .class-b`, means the class-b inside the class-a. 
   At the same time, two classes without space like `.class-a.class-b' refers to the object with both classes.
   

3. The use of "+" sign in CSS. For example, `nav ul li + li` refers to the first `<li>` after the `<ul><li>`, 
   in the case of this page, is actually the second `<li>`
