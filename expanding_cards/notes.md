##Notes:

###CSS
1. Collapse animation can be realized by flex display and flex property
   

2. `background-size: cover;` can be used to resize the background image to cover the entire container, 
   even if it has to stretch the image or cut a little bit off one of the edges

   
3. `cursor` property can be used to change the shape of the the cursor


4. `opacity` property used to change the transparent rate, 0 means 0% and 1 means 100%


5. In CSS, while selecting two classes, there should not be space between them


6. The use of `nth-of-type()` in CSS


7. The use of `@media`. For example, `@media(max-width: 480px) {}` 
   means that styles inside are only going to take effect if the screen is under 480 pixels

###JavaScript
1. `forEach` method can be used to operate on a collection of objects.

2. The use of arrow function. 
   
e.g.

     panel.addEventListener('click', () => {
            removeActiveClass();
            panel.classList.add('active');
            panel.h2
        });
